This project integrates state-of-the-art algorithms to generate 3D maps using the Kinect sensor. The provided solution is intended to take advantage of the two main sensors that the Microsoft Kinect device contains, which are the RGB camera and the range sensor. A first approximation to the trajectory of the sensor is estimated using a pairwise alignment approach using keyframe point clouds. To avoid cummulative error this project uses a GraphSLAM approach, that mitigates the drift in the trajectory and therefore, inconsistencies in the map.
